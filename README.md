# My AppDaemon Config
This is the my appdaemon configuration for Home Assistant.  These dashboards are configured to work on a Kindle Fire 8 HD running FUlly Kiosk, and are dedicated for home control use.

A few notes:
- HUGE thanks to Renetode for the guidance on the CSS, without which this would not have been possible!
- The graphs are generated with Grafana (reports), and are included in the dash iframe panels, but configuring that is not included here
- Under the Reports section, primary categories are on the left (temp, energy, etc) and the time frames are on the right.  As I create more reports, etc I will follow that construct.
- There are a few components that include passwords - they are in a separate include that is not part of this repo (for obvious reasons)

Hope this helps folks!

Bob
